## About Me
I’m an **Operations Research Engineering student at Cornell University** with experience in **data science, machine learning, and software engineering**.  
Through roles at **Microsoft**, **Fred Hutch Cancer Center**, and Cornell’s **AI Studio** + **INFO 2950**, I’ve built strong skills in data analysis, modeling, visualization, and human-centered problem solving.

My work focuses on the intersection of **technology, equity, and social impact**—especially improving healthcare access and understanding vulnerability across communities.
